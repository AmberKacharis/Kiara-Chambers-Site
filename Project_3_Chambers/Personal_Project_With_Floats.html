            <h3>Intoduction to Sanderson</h3>

            <p>Brandon Winn Sanderson (born <time datetime="1975-12-19">December 19, 1975</time>) is an American author of high fantasy and science fiction. He is best known for the Cosmere fictional universe, in which most of his fantasy novels, most notably the Mistborn series and The Stormlight Archive, are set. Outside of the Cosmere, he has written several young adult and juvenile series including The Reckoners, the Skyward series, and the Alcatraz series. He is also known for finishing Robert Jordan's high fantasy series The Wheel of Time. Sanderson has created several graphic novel fantasy series, including White Sand and Dark One.</p>

            <p>He created Sanderson's Laws of Magic and popularized the idea of "hard magic" and "soft magic" systems. In <time datetime="2008">2008</time>, Sanderson started a podcast with author Dan Wells and cartoonist Howard Tayler called Writing Excuses, involving topics about creating genre writing and webcomics. In <time datetime="2016">2016</time>, the American media company DMG Entertainment licensed the movie rights to Sanderson's entire Cosmere universe, but the rights have since reverted back to Sanderson. Sanderson's March <time datetime="2022">2022</time> Kickstarter campaign became the most successful in history, finishing with 185,341 backers pledging $41,754,153.</p>

            <h3>Personal Life</h3>

            <h4>Early life and education</h4>

            <p>Brandon Winn Sanderson was born on <time datetime="1975-12-19">December 19, 1975</time>, in Lincoln, Nebraska, the eldest of four children. Sanderson was a "reluctant reader" as a child, but became passionate for the medium after being given a copy of Dragonsbane by Barbara Hambly when he was 14. He made several early attempts at writing his own stories. After graduating from high school in <time datetime="1994">1994</time>, he went to Brigham Young University (BYU) as a biochemistry major. He took a two-year leave of absence from <time datetime="1995">1995</time> to <time datetime="1997">1997</time> to serve as a volunteer missionary for the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints and was assigned to serve in South Korea.</p>

            <p>After completing his missionary service, Sanderson returned to BYU and changed his major to English literature. While an undergraduate, Sanderson took a job as a night auditor at a local hotel in Provo, Utah, as it allowed him to write while working. One of Sanderson's roommates at BYU was Ken Jennings, who nearly ten years later became famous during his 74-game win streak on the American game show Jeopardy!. Sanderson graduated from BYU in <time datetime="2000">2000</time> with a Bachelor of Arts. He continued on as a graduate student, receiving an M.A. in English with an emphasis in creative writing in <time datetime="2004">2004</time>. While at BYU, Sanderson was on the staff of Leading Edge, a semi-professional speculative fiction magazine published by the university, and served as its editor-in-chief for one year.</p>
            <p>In <time datetime="2006">2006</time>, Sanderson married Emily Bushman, an English, Spanish, and ESL teacher and fellow BYU alumna who later became his business manager. They have three sons and reside in American Fork, Utah.</p>

            <h2>Career</h2>

            <p><a href="#top">Top</a></p><!--sends you back to the top-->

            <h3>Early writing career</h3>

            <figure class="fl300">

                <figcaption>Brandon Sanderson with a German copy of Elantris</figcaption>
            </figure>

            <p>Sanderson wrote consistently throughout his undergraduate and graduate studies; by <time datetime="2003">2003</time>, he had written twelve novels, though no publisher had accepted any of them for publication. While in the middle of a graduate program at BYU, he was contacted by Tor Books editor Moshe Feder, who wanted to acquire one of his books. Sanderson had submitted the manuscript of his sixth novel, Elantris, a year and a half earlier. Elantris was published by Tor Books on <time datetime="2005-10-03">April 21, 2005</time>, to generally positive reviews. This was followed in <time datetime="2006">2006</time> by Mistborn: The Final Empire, the first book in his Mistborn fantasy trilogy, in which "allomancers"—people with the ability to 'burn' metals and alloys after ingesting them—gain enhanced senses and control over powerful supernatural forces.</p>
            
            <p>He published the second book of the Mistborn series The Well of Ascension in <time datetime="2007">2007</time>. Later that year, Sanderson published the children's novel Alcatraz Versus the Evil Librarians, about a boy named Alcatraz with a talent for breaking things. Alcatraz confronts a group of evil librarians who are bent on taking over the world. The first of his "laws of magic" were first published in <time datetime="2007">2007</time>, with the second and third published in <time datetime="2012">2012</time> and <time datetime="2013">2013</time> (respectively). In <time datetime="2008">2008</time>, the third and final book in the Mistborn trilogy was published, titled The Hero of Ages, as well as the second book in the Alcatraz series, titled Alcatraz Versus the Scrivener's Bones. That same year, he started the podcast Writing Excuses with Howard Tayler and Dan Wells.</p>

            <h3>The Wheel of Time</h3>

            <p>Sanderson rose to prominence in late <time datetime="2007">2007</time> when Harriet McDougal, the wife and editor of author Robert Jordan, chose Sanderson to complete the final books in Jordan's epic fantasy series The Wheel of Time after Jordan's death. McDougal asked Sanderson to finish the series after being deeply impressed by his first Mistborn novel, The Final Empire. Tor Books made the announcement on <time datetime="2007-12-07">December 7, 2007</time>. After reviewing what was necessary to complete the series, Sanderson and Tor announced on <time datetime="2009-03-30">March 30, 2009</time>, that a final three books would be published instead of just one.</p>

            <p>The first of these, The Gathering Storm, was published on <time datetime="2009-10-27">October 27, 2009</time>, and reached the number-one spot on the New York Times bestseller list for hardcover fiction. Towers of Midnight, the second-to-last The Wheel of Time book, was published just over a year after The Gathering Storm on <time datetime="2010-11-02">November 2, 2010</time>, debuting at number one on the bestseller list. In early <time datetime="2013">2013</time>, the series was completed with the publication of A Memory of Light.</p>

            <h3>Career</h3>

            <p>In <time datetime="2009">2009</time>, Tor Books published Warbreaker, which originally appeared serially on Sanderson's website while he was writing the novel from <time datetime="2006">2006</time> to <time datetime="2009">2009</time>. In the same year, the third Alcatraz book was published, titled Alcatraz Versus the Knights of Crystallia. In <time datetime="2010">2010</time>, Sanderson published The Way of Kings, the first of a planned ten-book series called The Stormlight Archive. It achieved the number seven slot on the New York Times hardcover fiction bestseller list. The fourth Alcatraz novel, Alcatraz Versus the Shattered Lens, followed soon after.</p>

            <p>In October <time datetime="2011">2011</time>, he finished a novella e-book, Infinity Blade: Awakening, based on the action role-playing, iOS video game Infinity Blade, developed by Chair Entertainment and Epic Games. In <time datetime="2011-11">November 2011</time>, he published a sequel to the Mistborn trilogy, Mistborn: The Alloy of Law. It was originally planned as a standalone novel set about 300 years after the original trilogy, but it was later expanded into a four-book series. It debuted at number nine on the combined print and e-book New York Times Best Seller list.</p>

            <p>On <time datetime="2012-08-31">August 31, 2012</time>, Sanderson published a science fiction novella entitled Legion, followed by another short work titled The Emperor's Soul.

In <time datetime="2015-01">January 2015</time>, the second book of The Reckoners, titled Firefight, was published.

            <p>DMG Entertainment optioned the Cosmere in <time datetime="2016">2016</time> for film and television. On <time datetime="2016-11-22">November 22, 2016</time>, an anthology of Cosmere short stories and novellas was published, titled Arcanum Unbounded: A Cosmere Collection.

            <p>Sanderson announced in <time datetime="2022-03">March 2022</time> that, over the previous two pandemic years, he had secretly written five otherwise-unannounced books (four full adult novels and a shorter junior novel). The full novels (three of which are set in the Cosmere) were made available through a Kickstarter subscription that releases them quarterly through <time datetime="2023">2023</time>.

            <h2>Cosmere</h2>

            <p><a href="#top">Top</a></p><!--sends you back to the top-->
            
            <p>The Cosmere is the name of the universe in which Elantris, Mistborn, Warbreaker, The Stormlight Archive, White Sand, Tress of the Emerald Sea, Yumi and the Nightmare Painter, The Sunlit Man, and stories contained in Arcanum Unbounded: The Cosmere Collection are all set. This idea came from Sanderson's desire to create an epic-length series without requiring readers to buy a ridiculous number of books. Because of that, he hides connections to his other works within each book, creating a "hidden epic". He has estimated that the Cosmere sequence could conclude with at least 40 books.</p>

            <p>The story of the Cosmere is about a mysterious being called Adonalsium, who existed on a world known as Yolen. Adonalsium was killed by a group of at least eighteen conspirators, causing its power to shatter into sixteen different Shards, each of which bears immense power. Sixteen of those people—referred to as Vessels—then took these Shards and traveled to new worlds, populating them with different systems of magic or extending on ones already present. In one case, the Shards Ruin and Preservation worked together to actually create a planet and its people (Scadrial, as featured in Mistborn).</p>

            <p>Each Shard has an Intent, such as Ambition or Honor, and a Vessel's personality is changed over time to bring them more in-line with their Intent. One such Shard, Odium, has killed—or "splintered"—several other Shards. On Sel, he splintered Devotion and Dominion, accidentally creating the Dor, from which Seons and Skaze have emerged. On Roshar, Odium splintered Honor and brought about the Everstorm and the True Desolation. He has also splintered Ambition, in the Threnody system. A man known as Hoid is seen or mentioned in most Cosmere books. He travels the so-called Shardworlds, using the people of those worlds to further an unknown agenda.</p>

            <p>Sanderson has indicated that an upcoming work in the series will be in the Cyberpunk genre, a marked departure from the setting of the high-fantasy and urban-fantasy settings that have featured in the Cosmere universe to date.</p>
