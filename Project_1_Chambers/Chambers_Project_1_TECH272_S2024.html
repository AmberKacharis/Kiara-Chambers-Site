<h1>Kiara Chambers</h1>
<p>I was born is Utah, but I only lived there for a couple of years before we moved to New York. Since then, we have moved to Florida, back to New York, and back to Florida. I have taken a variety of coding courses online with many different programming languages, including HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Python.</p>
<p>In the past year we moved to Maryland, and we are planning on staying in this location for a long time. I am currently taking three college classes with the Dual Enrollment program at MC. These classes are ENGL 101, GDES 140, and this class, TECH 272. I <strong>really enjoy</strong> my graphic design class, and I'm looking forward to this class as well!</p>
<p>In ten years, I hope to have graduated college with a major in <em>Computer Programming and Game Design</em>. I also hope to have a successful career in this field. </p>
